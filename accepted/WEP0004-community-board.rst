WEP0004 - Updated team structure and community board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract
========

This WEP further refines the WTD team structure to reflect a more accurate workload breakdown, renames the community council to community board with Mikey Ariel as the chair and coordinator, and clarifies more of the roles and responsibilities of each team and team leader in the organization. 

To see the proposed changes, see this PR: https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/1811

Motivation
==========

After we implemented the original team restructure WEP, we realized that the breakdown of teams was too granular compared to the actual workload distribution in the organization. 

Link to the original team restructure WEP0003: https://github.com/writethedocs/weps/blob/main/accepted/WEP0003-wtd-org-structure-governance.rst

We also recognized a gap in the community council, since the CoreOps team was entrenched in conference-driven work and didn't have the capacity to manage the community backlog and initiatives or launch the board meetings that we wanted to start holding.

In September 2022, Mikey Ariel decided to step down from her role as the Prague conference chair, and proposed to step in to the community board as the chair and coordinator for the meetings and Trello board. 

The CoreOps team decided to take this opportunity to further refine the team structure in a way that will create a more accurate view of the current organization based on current operations, and to start operating the community board as intended. 

Proposal
========

The complete new team structure is documented in a different PR: https://github.com/writethedocs/www/pull/1811

However, for the purpose of this WEP here is a summary of the changes:

- Some teams were merged into the CoreOps team, since the work is performed by the CoreOps members (such as Support, Infrastructure, Code of Conduct). 
- The Documentation Guide team was renamde to "Learning Resources" to help support future website content refactoring. 
- Two new teams were created (Marketing, Sales) with the goal of expanding those operations in the future. 
- The community council was renamed "community board" for accuracy, and now has explicit responsibility for strategic decision-making.
- All team leaders are now board members and the roles explicitly include a paid stipend.
