Write the Docs Enhancement Proposals (WEPs)
===========================================

Welcome to the WEP repo!

WEPs_ are a formalized process for making major policy changes in the Write the Docs community.
Previously the way decisions were made was consensus on a Slack channel or at a conference,
based mostly on the people who happened to be there at the time.
This process wasn't transparent,
inclusive,
and also didn't leave written records that people could refer back to.

We hope that WEPs will make it explicit how major changes are made inside the community.
New contributors can propose them with a well-defined process,
but can also see WEP's proposed by existing contributors.
WEP's are the first step towards having a more open and defined model for governance,
but certainly not the last.
All further governance changes are planned to go through the WEP process,
so it is truly foundational for ongoing work on how the community is managed.

The WEP process is documented in detail in WEP0_.
There is also more information in our blog post `introducing WEPs`_.
