WEP0003 - Write the Docs organizational structure and governance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Abstract
========

This WEP aims to define the WTD organizational structure, including team responsibilities, accountability, collaboration, and community governance. 
The WEP also defines how to join and leave teams, and we welcome team member applications from the community.


Motivation
==========

Since WTD started as a grassroots community, we've grown globally to a point where we need more explicit definitions of the organizational teams. 
We now have many different types of teams and roles, and having clear descriptions for each team as well as paths to join and leave teams will bring more transparency to our governance models and give the community a better idea of how to contribute. 

We've already established high-level `Community Principles and Governance <https://www.writethedocs.org/about-us/https://www.writethedocs.org/about-us/>`__, and this WEP builds on those principles.


Proposal
========

This WEP proposes an explicit team structure and describes the governance chain when performing tasks and making decisions in the WTD community. 


Terminology
-----------

Team
  Group of humans responsible for a specific aspect of the community.
  
Team Member
  Human responsible for performing the team tasks. Reports to the team lead.
  
Team Lead
  Human responsible for managing the team. Accountable for the results of the team. Serves on the community council and votes on internal organizational changes.

Community Council
  Group of all the team leads. Proposes and votes on internal organizational changes, such as infrastructure and brand design.


How teams operate and interact
------------------------------

- **All membership and leadership roles are staffed by enthusiastic opt-in.** We want to prioritize the well-being of our contributors, and we're happy to have you if you're happy to contribute to the community. 
- Each team operates independently except for actions that impact other teams or the community.
- Each team is responsible for implementing and monitoring community guidelines, including CoC, within their team's area. 
- All teams leads are included in the community council, which can propose and vote on internal organizational changes and processes. 
- Team leads can serve on multiple teams, as much as their capacity and well-being allows.
- CoreOps team members act as interim team leads in case team leads step down without a replacement.
- Teams are generally comprised of volunteers. Depending on the scope and time investment of team leads, payment can be offered for ongoing service to people who have shown dedication to their role in the community.


Decision-making process
-----------------------

- The default process for making decisions in WTD follows a fuzzy/lazy consensus methodology. This means a proposal can be supported, objected to, or ignored. Any objections are discussed within the group that makes the decision, and if the objections are resolved then the proposal is accepted with any adjustments that might be implemented based on feedback. Teams can decide to modify this process based on their needs.
- Community-wide changes must use the WEP process and receive community approval. For more information, see `Scope of WEPs <https://github.com/writethedocs/weps/blob/master/accepted/WEP0000.rst#scope-of-weps>`__.
- Internal organizational changes do not need to use the WEP process, but must be approved by the community council. Examples include switching email tools, infrastructure improvement, brand updates, or vendor selection for global resources.
- Team-specific changes can be processed independently by agreement in the team, but each team lead is responsible to report such changes to the council and update the community-facing documentation as needed. 


Joining and leaving teams
-------------------------

Team members
  - Team members serve for a minimum of three months.
  - Membership renews automatically after joining. To step down from the team, members need to give a 14-day notice to the team lead before the end of the term.
  - Team membership requirements:
    - be an active member of the community for at least one year (online or at events)
    - be approved by the team lead and at least one additional team member from any team
    - satisfy the membership requirements of that team as specified in each team section
    - have sufficient English communication skills to perform the role in the teams, (English editorial skills are required in all teams that communicate in an official capacity, such as the Newsletter or Social Media team)

Team leads
  - Team leads serve for a minimum of one year.
  - Membership renews automatically after joining. To step down from the team, team leads need to give a 30-day notice to the community council before the end of the term.
  - Team lead role requirements:
    - be an active member of the community for at least two years (online or at events)
    - be approved by the community council
